# Simple Vehicle Mod for Garry's Mod

SVMod is a free addon that adds features to vehicles.
The objective is to provide a stable, high-performance and ergonomic tool.

We are the creators of Simple Roleplay, a French RP server inspired by PERP and DarkRP and has the particularity to be almost fully home-made.
We were using VCMod to improve the vehicles, but the tool was unstable and bug fixes were slow to roll out. It wasn't rare to see players who couldn't see the vehicle lights, to see players getting out of their cars to appear in the walls, or even to have to restart the server because the addon had crashed. So we developed SVMod, an alternative less beautiful than VCMod, but which has the honor to be made for large server with stability needs.
